# Graphs & BFS (Breadth First Search)

Graphs are a way To Model How Different Things Are Connected to one Another, <br/>

Each Graph is Made of (Nodes & Edges) Node Connected to Many Other Nodes Those Nodes Are Called **Neighbors** <br/>

##### Neighbors

Two Nodes Directly Connected to Each Other

## BFS (Breadth First Search)

We have Seen Sequential Search and Binary Search But BFS Is a Different Kind Of Search Algorithm that runs
on Graphs. <br/>

it Can Help Answer two Types of Questions

- is There a path from node A to Node B
- What is the shortest path from Node A To Node B
