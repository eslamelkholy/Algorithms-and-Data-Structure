# Graphs & BFS (Breadth First Search)

Graphs are a way To Model How Different Things Are Connected to one Another, <br/>

Each Graph is Made of (Nodes & Edges) Node Connected to Many Other Nodes Those Nodes Are Called **Neighbors** <br/>

##### Neighbors

Two Nodes Directly Connected to Each Other

## BFS (Breadth First Search)

We have Seen Sequential Search and Binary Search But BFS Is a Different Kind Of Search Algorithm that runs
on Graphs. <br/>

it Can Help Answer two Types of Questions

- is There a path from node A to Node B
- What is the shortest path from Node A To Node B

### Use Cases

- Wrute Checkers AI That Calculate Fewest Moves to Victory
- Spell Checker
- Closest Doctor in your Network
- Shortest Path to your Friend

### Steps Is Easy

- Model Problem as A Graph Data Structure
- Solve the Problem Using **DFS**

### Finding Shortest Path

There is Question we Must Ask Before we find Shortest Path

- is There a Path From Node (A) To Node (B)
- What is the Shortest Path From Node (A) To Node (B)

### IMPORTANT Order BFS Works

You Must Search People or Nodes in the Order They're Added There is a Data Structure to Handle the Order for this
For Sure it's Called Queue (First in First Out)
